If gender is a cultural construct created as a performative act then what is the point of
transitioning from one sex to another? This makes the act as something without meaning.


Alex Hai transitioned in a way that was complete. If one still feels as though they are a woman who
is becoming an Gondalier, as though this is a novelty, then they are not fully masculine in mental
outlook.

We want to have our cake and eat it too. We at once want to have a gender difference, such that it
matters if the president is female, or if there is equality of sex on corporate boards. Yet, we
would also have gender be something that is purely a byproduct of society, something that has no
inherent meaning aside from one culturally and arbitrarity given. How does this not confuse the
meaning of sex? If we have it one or the other, we break with a core ideological axiom.

If being a gender means something, then it must also include all the prejudices of the gender. This
is to think certain thing about the opposite sex as a counterpoint to what oneself is. In most
aspects of life, it is the inverse that define what one is, not the thing in and of itself. Does
this not mean then that in the end one does no want to be the other gender, but one can never
transcend the gender that one is born into.


Feminism as such assumes that there is meaning in the eponymous category. This was the first
dichotomy, to name woman after a goal of eliminating the category to which it is named.
