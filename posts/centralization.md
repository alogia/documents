In the conservative sensibility there will always be bit of the Jeffersonian
agrarianism. It is understandable being that The Big Sort
Centralization is in the zeitgeist of today. All the world seems to be
collecting itself into larger homogenes, both politically and culturally. Even
language is subject to this sway, with Europe denuding itself of regional
dialects in place of the acrolect and the national language. 


Five million people each month move to the city in developing countries. The
city is the ultimate idea of centralization, bringing together people by
proximity and through this a cultural homogeneity. 

Part of this centralization is out of necessity, the need to standardize in a
world that produces at scale and in scales that span the globe. This
necessitates the creation of standard measures and weights, but does this also
necessitate the suit and tie as obligatory in the world of global business? The
Chinese wear the same attire as the Indians when they both meet in Davos.

Cultural homogenes are also on the rise, while at the same time, the
institutions which formed a sense of society prior are all disappearing. We
amalgamate ourselves into an institutional framework whose middle seems to be
hollowing out. This chasm creates a real sense of distance from the forces which
act in our lives to give us the sense of place and meaning leaving us to float
into a homogeneous cloud of abstract collections. Those people who know and
interact with their neighbors are less and less while we commune with a mass of
indiscriminate others on Twitter who no nothing of our lives and selves. It is
in this way that the Twitter hoard has its power: it has removed the individual
from consideration.

In this way we have also removed people from our discourse. We no longer has
discussions about the viability of a politician as a person who is fully
themselves, but instead talk only of types of people and their category as
meaningful. The modern American has learned to stereotype on different axis then
we have in the past. No longer do we have the Catholics and the Jews as our
enemy, but now it is the white and the male. The interesting difference is in
that there seems to be no longer cleanly defined in-groups and out-groups, but a
mix of groupings that critique themselves in many instances such that the lines
are drawn into one's own territory. One can now be enemy and ally at once; one
by means of defined category, the other by intent. It is in this way that the
question of the viability of the group begins to becomes confused. If one can
violate the essence of the category and make it but accident, have we not then
broken the notion of the category and made it instead a rather clumsy
stereotype?

Centralization of the notion of connectedness with use of taxes in Nordic
countries. It is by and through the use of taxes that the sense of community is
built. Is this the same as the Mormons of the US? Mormons believe that one must
commit 10% of income to the church, is this the same thing as the Nordic
countries with their tax schemes? Can it be that the high taxes are the origin
of the trust shown in the country?

Economists such as Nima Sanandaji seems to confuse pure economic gain as the
totality of vectors by which a country should control its policies. Governments
such as those of Denmark and other Nordic countries create a safety net which
controls for the vicissitudes of life. This may indeed cost something in terms
of pure economic gain if one were to instead price out ever piece of the welfare
state.
