Centralization is in the zeitgeist of today. All the world seems to be collecting itself into larger homogenes, both politically and culturally. Even language is subject to this sway, with Europe denuding itself of regional dialects in place of the acrolect and the national language. 

Part of this centralization is out of necessity, the need to standardize in a world that produces at scale and in scales that span the globe. This necessitates the creation of standard measures and weights, but does this also necessitate the suit and tie as obligatory in the world of global business? The Chinese wear the same attire as the Indians when they both meet in Davos. 

Cultural homogenes are also on the rise, while at the same time, the institutions which formed a sense of society prior are all disappearing. We amalgamate ourselves into an institutional framework whose middle seems to be hollowing out. This chasm creates a real sense of distance from the forces which act in our lives to give us the sense of place and meaning leaving us to float into a homogeneous cloud of abstract collections.
