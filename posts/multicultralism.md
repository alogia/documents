We find ourselves at an asymptotic period of history where our morality exists
layered upon two planes; one of those Platonic, the realm of ideals to which
humanity strives as a systematic theology, something complete and
self-consistent. We live half the day in this world, and yet there is always the
other; that of the evolutionary out of which we have sprung and the ways by
which our biology drive us. We live on both these fronts in the battle for our
morality and our sociability and strive for a reconciliation which is every nigh
yet unhad.

We have come late to the notion that all cultures are, as we have believed long
about men as abstraction, created equal. Equality of culture though is a
funny thing, in as much as it has no divergence between the essential and the
accidental. All culture is accidental, a product of the forces of myriad
millennia that culminate in an arbitrary set of cultural assumptions. This is
not to say that the same thing is also not true of humanities evolutionary path,
but we will give to axiom man's existence as such. If we build upon this a bit
more, we end up in the land of lex naturalis, another assumption of an a priori
fact, a thing which we need not look to hard at. 

But then after this we end up in culture, a seemingly arbitrary set of
differentiators which we at the same time call upon to define ourselves. The
Jews were probably the first to fully inculcate this: They made themselves the people
who did not eat pork or shellfish, who did not wear mixtures of wool and
linen. It was not because these made sense, but because they did not that the
culture could define themselves by these signifiers. The Jews did this at a time
of scarcity, a time at which choosing food and clothing was a matter actual
sacrifice. Humanity is loosing the art of sacrifice in the act of choosing, while
at the same time the availability of all things, all choices, grows
exponentially and without restriction. Culture is no longer a matter of
necessity, of being in a time and a place and therefore subject to the forces in
and of that world. We now choose because choice is definition, not necessity.
    
Food again can be a suitable metric for the forces which I mean to indict:
Cuisine is or will be universal in all major cities and no longer bound by the vicissitudes
of climate and history. Yet we call back to our heritage in our aliment more
then ever as we now choose with purpose this cuisine over all others at ready
hand and in this we find our differentiation.

All familiality is radiation from the nuclear family, or as Burke wrote,

We gradate from this first attachment outward, first to the extended family,
and then to the circumvallation of friends and those who one knows as people
individuated from humanity as a whole. Then we move to those who we think of as
our kinsman, the mass of men who we know not by name but have instead only a
sense of the similarity of experience in a way cognizable. We can imagine our
life as theirs without stretching too far the bounds of what we consider a life
unfolding in a natural manner. This sort of sympathic response is bound by a
layer of episteme which form the cultural background with which we consider
choice, and the understandability of the other. With our neighbors we allow

Multiculturalism is at its heart to allow others to vary in ways which cannot by
definition be understandable between cultures. It has to be a thing subterranean
to its adherents and esoteric to the outsider. Culture is to assume before
assumption and to inveigh against a question slipped too deep into the
firmament. Only with another culture are we unable to create a narrative out of
seemingly unrelated events, to pull a story which makes sense from the chaos and
think ourselves a possible character in this history but for mere chance.

As with all these notions, there has be constructed some vast difference between
the dominant culture, and
