Well, the much anticipated debate between the two heavyweights thinkers of the
underground internet have finally met; And as could have been guessed at, left
only a sense of disappointment. The public intellectual of today is never
limited to a scope of his study, but is asked to pronounce upon all thing in the
world, even those who he has no knowledge of and in these cases with the most
vigor. This is to pull all the world into a narrative from which one can pull
conclusions at need, a totalizing narrative to which can contain the who
world. And so was the debate between Peterson and Zizek, two thinkers who did a
very eloquent job of talking past each other. 

It was Peterson who opened the event with a show of his inadequate reading of
both Zizek and Marx all wrapped nicely around a cursory commentary of The
Communist Manifesto complete with a litany of Jordan's Best Of applause
lines. This was at least a piece crafted to the event, as Zizek was to
instead just give a rehash of the same arguments  he has been espousing for the
last several years with nothing much to say to the event or to his
interlocutor. Peterson should be given his due for at least trying to tailor his
remarks to his opponent, even though it was an opponent of his own making
gleaned from headlines and flippant remarks made by Zizek. 

So Peterson gave Zizek his best, hierarchies of ability and all. Aside from the
dusting of his personal phraseology, it was a speech which could have been given by any
of the lights of the Right. If Peterson had spoken a bit faster he could have
passed for a Canadian Ben Shapiro rehashing some paean to capitalism and self
interest. This might all be true, but in the context of the debate it was only to
beat a dead horse that no one was riding. Zizek calls himself a Marxist at
times, even a Stalinist at others, but to anyone who has even a passing
understanding of his politics in practice knows that this is an
oversimplification at best, and an un-ironic attempt at being provocative at
worst. Peterson took the bait and found his conservative stride, even going so
far as to claim that he charges for his psychiatric services for the sole reason
that doing so ensures his product is not extraneous. Aside from this sounding
extraordinarily self-serving, his logic failed to encompass the complexities of
any first-world mixed economy in which governmental re-distributive societal
goods form a substantial part of the expectation of most people. The irony in
this is that Canadians health care is one of those social goods to which he
fails to acknowledge in his zeal to raze the specter of Marx. 

Peterson's provincialism in underwhelming as a totality. Aside from completely
misunderstanding the Marxist doctrines of class are not inherent in people
themselves, but to the system itself. That iss to say that any given person
occupying any given place in a capitalist system will always act that given
part. The owners of the means of production will always have the same incentives
regardless of who arbitrarily ends here. 

When Peterson talks about the inability to divide people between the oppressor
and the oppressed he is basically rehashing axioms of intersectionality, that
there are overlapping forms of oppression and oppressiveness that one can
simultaneously be part of. One need not choose a camp, but can exist in the flux
of camps, both and neither at the same time. Congratulations, Peterson has
discovered intersectionality!

----->>>> Relisten to the opening

And then it was time for Zizek. As is the case with any talk by Zizek, there is
only ever a very tenuous "theme", instead his delivery tends to a miss-mash of
entwined and divergent thoughts who at once give credence to the complexity of
the world, but also give evidence of his argument as shallow when discussing
something which cannot be contained or explained by anyone so broad a
theoretician. The pervasive anecdotes which so often make Zizek so charming, and
do often function as perfect explication of points which would be said less well
in logic, there is a hint of his global economic understanding being too often a
flippant set of anecdotal exercises more than anything else. He speaks of
singularity as a dilettante who knows only of headlines. He talks of climate
change and of Chinese development patterns. He talks of theology and quantum
theory and many more things as is his want, but all these seems nothing more
than points made in shallow understanding. 

One of the main reasons as to why both men seem to more often than not miss the
argument made by the other is that they come at the middle ground from opposite
sides. Peterson wants to make the clinical psychology from whence he came to
explain the workings of societies at scale. Zizek wants to bring the
abstractions of Hegelian metaphysics into the realm of international relations.

One of the more interesting exchanges that was had revolved around one of
Peterson's oft claims that there exist a postmodern Neo-Marxist cabal which run
the universities of North America.  When pressed by Zizek to name an author(s)
who promote this contradiction, Peterson gave us some survey data done by
Jonathan Haidt an Heterodox Academy that concludes 25% of social scientists call
themselves Marxists.

It seems that the unaccredited source of the notion that there is some genealogy
between that of Marx and that of the SJWs of today is the book Explaining
Postmodernism by Stephen Hicks. It is this book which in 2013 made the
connection between the Marxist notion of class struggle and that of marginalized
groups in the current discourse. The totality of the connective tissue seems to
be that both are based upon the notion that there is a fundamental battle
between the oppressor and the oppressed, and as Peterson would have it, one was
as good as the other in the Neo-Marxist camp. 

As far as the historicity of this claim, it seems open to question, yet in
practice their does seem to be this odd alliance between the woke left and a
Marxist tilt. This has nothing to do with Foucault and Derrida which should have
been left out of the debate entirely as both have nothing to do with the current
debates in both camps. Foucault has a twisted history which started in Marxism,
led out and against it as a simplification of power hierarchies, and once again
reemerged as a hated character through the visage of feminism. Everyone argues
their lens and Foucault is a good connective tissue. Marx argued that there
existed inherent economic classes in society which structured life in ways that
were unnatural and abusive. Foucault took this, and finding that a pure
materialistic understanding of society was cheap, expanded and development the
notion of power till it included even language into the structures of
power. Once this opening had been made, the feminist philosophers could then
explore the relation of power to sex, this hierarchy could then expanded with
Kimberl√© Crenshaw into a doctrine that all systems of power could intersect in
ways which were not understandable as singularities. The reading of all society
as based in hidden systems of power could not exclude the Marxist notion of
class inside it, as it was too juicy a division to excise even though class as
thought of historically, being based on blood and heritage, has ceased to exist
as a category by which people evaluate each other. The modern notion of class is
merely a denotation of the success with which someone has had in life. It says
nothing about breeding or the right to a certain respect. The battles of the
nouveau riche have been fought and they have won. 

<9:19> Peterson's postmodern reading.

What Peterson fails to say is that to not be able to assign blame because this
is in-group/out-group thinking is to also not be able to speak of good and bad
as absolutes. One creates the categories and then applies them, not the other
way around, else we reach the question of Kierkegaard who would have the God of
Fear and Trembling, a god who respects no human dictates of well being, but is
instead merely capricious. A morality with no humans cannot be either good nor
bad, but a humanity with good and bad but no object is just action with an
arbitrary label.

Intersectionality has grown to the extent that any kind of restriction can be
cast in the light of a persecutorial framework. No longer does one have to
choose the oppressor and the oppressed as the system, but the system is open to
it all, be it men v. woman, gay v. straight, black v. white, trans v. cis. All
things are part and parcel now, all things intersect. There need not be a system
which governs the totality. 

What I found most odd about the whole affair was the audience. They came to
cheer and to pronounce hits and misses. While the audience seemed to be split in
loyalty, it was definitely more Peterson who drew devoted affirmations as though
he was pronouncing the glory of God. Yet, how odd it was to hear applause at a
statement of human psychology? Is the hierarchical nature of human cooperation
really a ready applause line? It was this too ready assent which above all else
made me question the whole exercise of having two intellectuals on a stage
debating one another. How can this format not end in something other than just
spectacle? In public discourse, even those known for their ideas will all
eventually supersede themselves as personalities. Is this not the ultimate proof
that our primary attachment is not to the rational, but the mammalian, so that
in the end we love our intellectuals first as individuals and only secondarily
as a means to understanding. There is something to say for being dead as a
philosopher, as your ideas must then live and die on their own, severed from an
embodied parentage. 

It is not an impossible task to make meaningful a debate between living
thinkers, but one difficult to do well. There was the splendor of the clashes
between Vidal and Buckley, the strum und drang broken only by the ready
quip. The debate featured here was something more akin to Chomsky and Foucault;
two equally intelligent people who where having a debate with themselves while
uncannily sitting in the same room. The parameters of Foucault could not admit
that of Chomsky, and the language in which Chomsky spoke had no interest to
Foucault as it was still surface to his discourse.
