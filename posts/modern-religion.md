I remember a decade and a half ago when atheism first found its voice and came
charging into the public discourse, denouncing Christianity and waving around a
cudgel of rationality[^4].  The previous quiet skirmishes now past, the first
real battle in what would become the New Atheist movement was afoot, and in an
argumentative style it would break open the taboo on "atheism" as something one
believed only in the privacy of one's own home.  If one had been harboring a
quiet disdain for the whiff of that preachy air, one now had a champion, someone
whom could be cheered while obliterating the still unenlightened.  Events where
organized will titles such as "Religion: Societal good or societal ill", which
promised to settle once and for all life's most abstruse questions.  This was the
moment of glory for the self-coined Four Horsemen[^5], academics who had come
riding out of their tower to bring wrath upon the charlatans and peddlers of
faith, that most irrational and dangerous of memes.

Today this all seems a bit gauche, but at the time I remember a definite
intoxicating sense that a new crack in the culture had opened, that those who
thought dogma a holdover from another time had finally stormed the last bastion.
Of course a minority had always set upon their soapbox and decried religion as a
confidence trick or flowers on the chain, but never was this said so loudly, and
with so much righteous indignation.  No one noticed a truce with modernity had
been made, that religion was to be believed or tolerated indulgently, but never
really openly attacked, until the peace had broken down and war was already on.
It was now only to choose a side, this new form of transgression having opened a
whole new front in the culture war already in full swing.  It wooed its
proselytes, drew its battle lines, and everyone felt like they where engaged in
something very important.

Even though the battle raged, it was a time when a pan-political agreement held
that every candidate was Christian by assumption, bending the knee in ways
unbelievable if pressed.  Religion was still to be taken seriously in politics
by all sides with all actions being by definition found in scripture; this was
before those most moved by the Spirit voting en masse for Donald Trump (the
thrice married adulterer whose language was more pure Id than one enlightened by
Christian charity) and proved once and for all the homage given the Good Book
more a mask upon something ultimately as simple as power. 

Much has happened in the interim.  Thing are once again mainly quiet on the
religion front; But who then won?  This, as it turns out, a more complicated
question to answer then where the sides which fought have believed.  The result
is something more akin to the Peace of Westphalia than to that of Cannae.
Organized religion may indeed have been given a last lethal blow and is dying a
slow death in the West, but not in the way one would have guessed given the
lines on which the battle was fought.  Both sides thought in a binary, that
either one cast aside all irrationalities and gave oneself over completely to
science, or one doubled down on inerrancy and burned the books of the
evolutionists.  But in the end, there was no great triumph of the New Atheists,
who at this point have instead become passe.  Their momentary stridency flared
up and filled lovers and haters with the sense of impending victory a fleeting
second before the whole movement expended itself and faded into the
background. Also, while the faithful were always fighting something of a
rear-guard action and never really expected a Third Great Awakening, there was
no sudden rise of the Antichrist to lead the masses into temptation.  In the
end, like everything so seemingly existential to our modern limited attention
spans, the ever restless cultural discourse changed topic and everyone forgot to
consider religion at all.

Yet religion in America is in the process of remaking itself in ways no one
guessed. Church, the brick and mortar building which brings believers together
in congress to reaffirm as public act their faith, has increasingly fallen out
of favor. A corporate structure as scaffold in one's faith is on the wane as all
denominations are losing members year over year[^1].  Even among those who still
claim adherence to a mainline denomination the feeling of the necessity of
communion is less felt, of the common ritual as something foreign and strange.
More than 40% of millennials who claim for themselves Christianity no longer
claim a congregation. Even the Southern Baptist Convention, the archetype of US
evangelical faith and bastion of traditional belief, is hemorrhaging congregants
every year[^2].  What then remains of functionalism[^10] when all is belief and
nothing remains of the performative?

At the same time that unchurched believers were in the ascendant, the reprobate
have remade themselves not as New Atheists out to evangelize a still misled
world, but instead were busy reinterpreting religion a tool of the patriarchy
and therefore not only silly, but pernicious.  Now for the new Woke Left, if one
was to proclaim a faith too loudly or too biblically, one has in effect just
proclaimed oneself a misogynist in all but name (a certain dispensation given
the black community for 'cultural' reasons).  Religions new detractors conceived
of the traditional dogmas as something more akin to an effect than a cause and
so logical argumentation to be pointless endeavor.  Religion no longer caused
good people to do bad things (in Hitchen's formulation), but we were fallen
first, the original sin of patriarchy and oppression sewn deep in the occidental
mind from which the bible would be mere indictment.  Religion's adversaries no
longer were missionary, going out into the world with reason girding their loins
and ready to battle, but instead retired inside their new battlements only to
glower from atop their ever-growing theoretical walls.  In the new enlightened
interpretation, all was structures of power, and religion once more became
flowers on the chain.  But this time something even deeper and more insidious
than that of capital was at the source. 

The Right had always used religion as something of a political tool being by
nature a conservative institution, while the left has tip-toed in quiet ways
around the issue and tried to kluge their agenda into some religious language so
as to grant an indulgence to the progressive impulse. With so much of this at
odds with the new Woke understanding and the rest for personal interpretation,
now a days not much is said about one's faith in polite company, and not much is
asked.  It is a Don't Ask, Don't Tell for the 21st century.  One was free, nay
encouraged to believe what one will, but in a quiet personal way and to make no
great claim of universal truths.  The critique of the Reformation was that it
began with one Pope on the seven hills of Rome and ended with seven popes on
every dunghill in Europe; now there is no need of popes as each is to find a
spirituality not even bound by some restrictive allegiance to *sola scriptura*
or any such stricture.  One now is to innovate if sincere. 

In some ways this is to admittedly overstate the case.  Actually theological
knowledge has always been something suspect[^3], with only white Evangelical
Christians managing to get a score above 50% in surveys of basic biblical and
doctrinal knowledge (all other demographics falling south of half).  Most
congregants have always, it would seem, been happy with the conviction that
someone, somewhere has worked out the details and filled in the rest for
themselves.  Since the advent of polling, I know of no country or faith which
can claim its adherents show any real concern with questions above the most
basic tenants, and even these are asking too much most of the time.  There is a
fundamental reason why, if one has spent any time in church at all, that most
preaching is forever on basic level which never seems to progress.  Like
politics, one must stay on message, not deviate from the most over-simple of
points, and repeat this ad nauseam if one hopes to make even a basic notion
adhere in ones audience.  The only thing which seemed to invest a section of the
US with a new thirst for religious knowledge was the momentary thrust of atheism
into the dialog, and this only in some very limited way.  For that one second
both sides cracked open their bibles in an arms race that was never won by
either while both claimed victory.  And then everyone was bored with the debate
once again.

Religion may no longer be best word to describe the current diffusion of ideas.
For most it now seems a grab bag of bits stolen from a myriad contexts.
Kierkegaard would complain of the ease in which the Danes held their faith, a
passive belief which required no great struggle of self.  Today apathy extends
to any kind of doctrine and instead floats lightly in some vagary which is no
longer bounded by a larger theology, instead only subject to what one finds
appealing.  Belief in heaven tracks pretty consistently at 72% polled in
America, while hell, its more vindictive twin, is less certain with only three
quarters of those affirming the first also affirm its opposite[^6].  God seems
permanently popular[^7] at 80% polled, though I would suspect more ill defined
than previous years.  Monotheism has always been more an empty box for a concept
than one in-and-of itself.  Jesus added a theory of mind to the abstraction,
allowing a ready anthropomorphization to fill out the bones. Yet at the same
time, only a steadily declining slim majority associates God with the biblical
account.  What is left of anything concrete when the humanity of God as trinity
with Jesus fades, and the whole notion of the divine slips back into the
undefined?

One hears too frequently a flippant quoting of Chesterton, *“When men stop
believing in God, they don't believe in nothing — they believe in
anything.[^9]"* Yet it may indeed be true when given a wider lens for its object
less beholden to an idiomatic understanding of 'religion' as practiced in times
past.  John McWhorter writes in his essay *Antiracism, Our Flawed New
Religion[^8]* of the way the most irreligious demographic has re-imaged the
essence of sin and salvation into something which would probably be denied by
all involved, but in reality folding in a faith so clandestinely as to be
contested.  To the extent that Protestantism has always been iconoclastic,
desirous of the destruction of the symbols of faith and wishing to tear down the
cathedrals and instead make god immanent, they have succeeded beyond their own
imagining, liberating religion from any form of doctrine and spreading it
quietly out and into convictions based less in fideism to defined dogmas and
more thought of as esoteric enlightenment which has no bounds.
