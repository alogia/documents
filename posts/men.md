In modernity its an odd thing to be a man. The culture is constituted of two schools of thought, one
of which seems to hold ideas retrograde from the point to which we have come. The other seems to too
often no allow a middle ground, and makes statements which are too dogmatic to be incisive. Men have
to live between two ideas of themselves, one which is a recidivistic idea of the man which lives in
a certain relation to himself and those around him. The other has come out of modernity with a speed
which cannot be integrated into the psyche of those who demand it.

There will always be a tension between the two thing which woman want. There is something sexy about
a man who can cause violence to another person. There is a reason that warriors have been the upper
class of all societies but the current.
