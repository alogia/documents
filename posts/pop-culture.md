There is a specter haunting democracy.

There is a contradiction in both believing in a person's right to choose their
own life, to form it to their own will and to make of it whatever they want. Yet
at the same time, there is a contradiction: Like politics, people seem not to be
able to act in their own self interest. This is the death drive manifest in
reality TV, an annihilation of the self into another person's story. 

News has gone wrong on two fronts, one of which is to become too general, the
other of which is to become too specific.  The news of the day alternates between
these two, and never the twain shall meet. One of which degenerates into mere
gossip, the interpersonal so inane as to defy interest.  In the age of Trump,
this is the tweet of the day, or some other nonsense which will never actually
make it into any legislation of defined action.

Then there is the other impulse, that to generalize over entire civilizational
discourses and to talk of some metanarrative whose construct underlies the whole
basis of modernity as we know it. Both are silly; they are appeals to the base
instinct within us which needs to oversimplify on both sides. 

There is something paradoxical about the need both to report the news and to
also monetize it.  One part of the equation requires that there is some truth to
the narrative which is given, some basis of fact on which the story can be
placed and not just mere fiction.  This is the bit which will satisfy the needs
of the rational mind, the sense of oneself as an objective viewer of
informaiton.  Then there is the other side of news, which is the narrative
aspect.  The masses of man do not know how to take on the complexities of any
given topic and rely upon some class of elites to act as interpreters of the
information given.  As resistant to this notion as most are, this is the whole
attraction to the 24 hour new networks rehashing of the news through the
perspective of a rotating cast of talking heads.  One hour of news can be
stretched into a whole day of discourse which argues the one event. 

If one consumes news in this manner, one is not watching the news, but one is
instead working on a narrative about the news. One no longer is learning facts,
but is instead just working on a way to which to assimilate these facts to a
predefined world view which needs to structure all things in its proximity.
