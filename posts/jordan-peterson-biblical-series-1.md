Having listened to the totality of this lecture, I am amazed at the paucity of things that are
interesting or unique in all of it. There are some basic ideas that are a review of theories
derived, some from Freud, some from Nietzsche, but nothing of any unique value. 

One of the main notions with which Peterson seems to harp on is that there is a division between the
rational self, and part of the self with which he calls the dream world. This is the Jungian
unconscious which forms the substructure with which we exist in the world. 

Music as cultural identity 

As soon as we take these stories and talk about them as instances of the great generalizations which
form what it is to be human, we have also reach identity politics in that these are also
generalizations and abstractions about what it is to be human. 

Peterson believes that if the Atheists are correct in their notion of the falsity of God and that
this can be sold to the population as whole, that it will end in nothing other than the old peon
that the lack of organized religion does not end in the belief in nothing, but in anything. 

"There is more to your actions than you can understand." 
This seems to be nothing than a rephrasing of the notion of the super-ego. 

"One of the things Jung said is everybody acts out a myth but very few people know what their myth
is and you should know what your myth is because it might be a tragedy and maybe you don't want it
to be." -- Jordan Peterson
It is an interesting thing that Peterson claims that this a thing said by Jung, but there is no
known quote by him which actually says this. It seems that he is synthesizing many ideas of Jung and
calling them on thing. 

Peterson's notion of the referral of one link in the bible to anther is rather specious. There is
many question of how one "refers" to another section of the bible, especially including the new
testament and what one considers 'referral'. In the end it appears to be very subjective in origin. 

Jordan then does a simple apologists reading of the New Testament and claims that it was impossible
to know what would come at the end if one was to not know the beginning. This is a silly reading and
assumes that there is actually some truth inherent in the New Testament stories, and more than that,
that there is some definite relation of their meaning to that of the Old Testament. 

There is no known ability to remember more just because one is part of an oral culture.

Its an interesting thing that Chelsea has never once asked anything about how I or Chishimba is
doing or what we are up to. 

I wish I had something interesting to say about Chelsea. She exists in a way that I cannot fathom
and as such I have no theory of. She has in some ways done all the things necessary to becoming a
fully functional individual in that she owns her own home and has a degree. But then there is the
other side of her, which is to just sit in bed and smoke pot, watching TV and not talking to anyone
or thinking about anything. She is almost non-verbal at home, instead just doing life to the bare
minimum, just running out the clock on life. It is an interesting horrible way to go about the
world, in that all you want to do is as little as possible. To what end? I don't know. 

She at times says that she wants to run for president. I don't think that she knows the first thing
about any of the issues at hand, and instead wants to be president not for the sake of actually
doing anything, but instead just for seeming to have lived the ultimate full life. She says her
"Political Advisor" tells her that she is in want....
