I find that the question of how the current "woke" culture has come to be more intricate that I had
expected. There seems to be quite a diffuse origin of ideas which coalesced into something mutually
irreconcilable as a whole. 

One of the main questions which I have been stumped by is the connection which seems to occur
between those who are 'woke', which is more commentary on the structural nature of oppression in a
given society, and a belief in democratic socialism or at least a social democracy at least. These
are ideas which do not presuppose one another, and the nature by which these have been inextricably
interlinked comes from an evolution which brought things together in odd ways. 

-- What is the connection between social justice and the Frankfurt school? How did we start with a
capitalist framework and end with something which is only vaguely.
