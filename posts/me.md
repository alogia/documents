I used to write notes to myself about things to practice as a person.  I would write things like "Sit
up straight" and try to commit the practice to memory, to habit by sheer will.  I would want to
commit myself to other things.  I would call upon all the discontent of a life alone and make a
fiction from it as a person who was the thing that I had in mind. 

I would walk the night into the forest and call things by their name.  I would be the person who I
knew I needed to be,  I just had to have a bit more self-control and drive.  I would make of myself
a thing still inchoate.  I would live a thousand lives, and practice a thousand crafts. 

Life is a thing of finite dimension and must be cultivated with care.  I want life to be an art
project in itself.  I am not even sure what it is that is to be cultivated, but there will be
something, something that is in essence unique.  The creativeness in life is upon me. The necessity
to innovate and find a shtick not yet thought of, or one which was discarded and I can pick up. 

I think of the man in Alaska somewhere told to me in myth that spent his whole life reliving the
various stages of human progression in the wilderness of some Arctic plane.  He would spend days
hacking at a log with a stone to splinter it into something that could be with the most careful
cultivation be made fire. 

But at the same time I a wary of words. Like those of so many schools, it is the words which give
rise to something more than words, and the thinkers are then left in only the question of where
their mental masturbation became too real to support its incorporation into the actual world.  I
live an elitist life and refuse to not, a symptom of my bourgeois spirit I guess which calls into
the world something of ultimate pretense, that of a life lived meaningfully on its own terms. 

There is always the pull to Nietzsche, the pull to something that is transcendent in the only way
that can be had for a materialist: a life which is formed by some construct consummately one's own. 

The ideas of Marcuse are those which are had or lost on the societal level, but what I care for and
want is something sub-society.  I want something which can be had as a good to me only, some key that
I have found in life that will make me something more than another player in the same play.  I say
this and yet what have I done?  I have done only a few things on the edges to be really something
unique.  I need to let go of the rest of reservations by which I keep myself in the box which I do
and really be free to experiment. 

This is the fallacy that all those intellectuals fall victim to: they call for things which cannot
be had at the alter which they all worship at. In as much as they talk of society changing itself,
what they talk about is something that puts the personal into a mode which cannot actually exist in
the moment. This is the out which they will forever have. 

If one posits society as the target of ones wrath then in what way can one participate in it without
being nothing more than a hypocrite and pretender?  I agree that there is an ivy league which sits
atop a stack of straw and discourses upon right action in a society greater than one's own. In what
way can one talk of things which are greater than when one is so much a part of the system by which
one finds the critique. 

There are those which are specialists, which can exist only in the realms of the abstruse and in
something which is uncognizable.  These do not want to have any connection to the actuality of
living, and in this is where the solace is found, in the fact that there is something which is
avoided by the philosophy.  One can have their cake and eat it too, in that one can critique that
inherent in the culture but not have anything to do with its actually revolution. In the parlance of
the day one can talk the talk, but not walk the walk. 

To what end then do I have? There is only the theoretical on one side, and nothing on the other. It
is a strange thing to think of oneself as a creator of the values with which one then moves. 

Even Jesus was not an ubermench in the sense that there were a myriad psycho-social background
events which made Jesus possible. In this way, i guess I am a structuralist thinker.
