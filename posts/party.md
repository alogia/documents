Americans are no longer relying upon an association with a political party,
registering as Independents.  The interesting result of this is not a growing
third party or even an overwhelming centerism, but a reliance upon secondary
sources of ideology. 


Since the parties have given up any semblance of control and have allowed the
democratic empulse to extend into their inner workings, all the party functions
have been spinning off into a nexus of independent spheres.  The two influences
on first the left, and then the right are different, but end in the same place. 


The left has always been beholden to an assumed View from Nowhere, the mode
under which ideology hides from even its ardent expositors.  This purported
objectivity disallows any mention of party affiliation, and instead the veneer
of disinterest must be maintained.  It is in this way that the Progressive cause
promotes itself not as a party, but as an assumed ideology prior to party. 


On the right, the forces have been different given the state of the media before
the advent of internet sources.  The radio right in an interesting innovation
took ideology seriously and insisted that all politicians on their side do also.
They were to be the keepers of the Conservative flame and cast more scorn upon
those who compromised with heretics. 

And so it was that those who thought of themselves as Republicans became instead
conservatives.  They came not to align themselves with the Party as an
institution which acted in their life like the days of Tammany Hall.  At this
point, parties where institutions in the society.  What is left today is only
ideology drawn on distinct lines in some coherence that politics practice will
never allow.

Those in politics have always wanted to wrap their quest for power in a visage
of adherence to an external, which most of the time is an ideology.  In this
way, ideology can be used as a means by which to obscure the obvious attempt at
self-aggrandizement, and instead pretend that the ideas are primary like some
Neo-Platonic religiosity in which one abjures the ego.

Yet years of this have caused some large section of the voter-ship to agree with
the proposition that ideas precede individuals or institutions, and have learned
to ape a disinterest also.

The radio right were the first to realize that outrage was a drug in and of
itself, and one could spread it wider than originally assumed till it would even
cover one's own side.  The banal outrage of the demagogic hosts are not in
search of power themselves, and could then remain free of the necessity to
deviate from orthodoxy even when the situation demands an expansive
interpretation of one's axioms.

This will forever be the Achilles's heal of all politicians; one has to campaign
on poetry and govern in prose.  Politicians are right to be met with skepticism,
as they are apt to obviate any intricacy of all aspects of government.
