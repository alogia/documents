"I hate white men." 

This is the result of a narrative simplicity which has become the fad as of
late.  It is hard to imagine that a culture which will make Instagram
Influencers out of sheer bordom, who will generate Stans out of something of
consummate intellectual perversity, would not have a simplifying impulse always
in the category of race. 

If one is to try to puzzle out the cause of this constants, I would say that the
notion of a persecutorial force which convicts one of being what one is (which
is the basis of the third wave feminist critique of the world) fits naturally
into a mind which feels that one is less than.  This is the feeling quite common
to some of feeling at once both inferior to those around oneself, and at the
same time and in a contradictory fashion, feeling superior to those same people.
The ideology is believed for the reason of the former, but its effect is that of
the latter.  

Yet the ideas which are espoused are more those of the conspiracy theorist who
feels that the world is finally made understandable now that the pieces have
been put into place.  There is something seductive of the internal understanding
of a phenomena which is esoteric to the hoi palloi, it is the mystery school
phenomena still.  It is the drive to pull back the curtain on the world.

Yet this understating is in its essence impotent to do anything because its
causative factors are so nebulous and not thought out.  What does it mean to
fight the patriarchy when it is something which is so innate to the culture that
there is no choice.  If you make it episteme, then how is it that one speaks to
things which are beyond What is it to say that 

The racism of the lowered expectation inherent in allowing so much violence in
inner cities.  One cannot be outraged as one would at any other violence, but
must allow this as a product of forces outside of the community, outside of the
fact that one chooses to buy a gun and use it.  The number of shootings in
Chicago topped out at 4351 in 2016.  While there has been a fall since then, are
we all still to accept this as acceptable?  How can it be anything but the
subtle bigotry of low expectations?
