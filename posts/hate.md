"I hate white men." 

I have come to the conclusion that all those woman who need the Patriarchy as a construct to
understand the world are unhappy people to begin with.  I have met and worked with many, many woman
in my time, and it is only those who are most unhappy with themselves who find the Patriarchy a
convincing notion.  If this was something which was an occasional thing, I would not be so ready to
find correlation, but if all cases tend to the same coincidence, who am I to not draw conclusions?
If one is to try to puzzle out the cause of this constants, I would say that the notion of a
persecutorial force which convicts one of being what one is (which is the basis of the third wave
feminist critique of the world) fits naturally into a mind which fells that one is less than.  This
is the feeling quite common to some of feeling at once both inferior to those around oneself, and at
the same time and in a contradictory fashion, feeling superior to those same people.  The ideology is
believed for the reason of the former, but its effect is that of the latter.  It is the same impulse
to that of the conspiracy theorist who feels that the world is finally made understandable now that
the pieces have been put into place.  There is something seductive of the internal understanding of a
phenomena which is esoteric to the hoi palloi, it is the mystery school phenomena still.  It is the
drive to pull back the curtain on the world. 

Yet this understating is in its essence impotent to do anything because its causative factors are so
nebulous and not thought out.  What does it mean to fight the patriarchy when it is something which
is so innate to the culture that there is no choice.  If you make it episteme, then how is it that
one speaks to things which are beyond question. 

The notion that one can act upon knowledge derived from an understanding which is beneath that of
the conscious mind, that one can corral the culture into a set of defined 'better notions' is
something for the angels.
