The question of why one would care about history is an interesting one.  Does
the past repeat itself?  Probably less now than ever given technological and
societal changes.  Does one need to know the past to form a morality for the
present?  Not if one rejects so much of the past as immoral in most aspects.
In what way then does one use history meaningfully today then?

One must assume that historical knowledge, born in a set of memorized facts, is
primary to our culture, not the subterranean way that we have all been made out
of a historical process acting upon ourselves and our assumptions.
