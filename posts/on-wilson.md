As of late, it seems the legacy of Woodrow Wilson has been dredged up as a new
whipping boy for some large segment of the right.  George Will to Jonah Goldberg
have all found him once more an easy and convenient target being that he showed
less that complete genuflection for the constitution, instead pointing out that
there may indeed be some places in which the ideals of the constitution must be
reconciled with the evolutionary way in which the practice has developed. 

The totem of the Declaration and the Constitution are inviolate to this
demographic, a fiction useful and necessary, but at the same time already
permeable, as the constitution has had amendments aplenty.  What is an amendment
if not an admission that some aspect of the constitution needed a
revision.  This is not a mere clarification, but supersession.  If one is to agree
with a single overridden sentence, one has already conceded the infallibility of
the Founding Fathers.  One then can argue merely degree and no longer principle. 

There same conservatives would argue both ways when in comes to the Founder's
abhorrence of democracy practiced to extensively.  The hierarchy of states to the
federal government is changed as soon as the Seventeenth Amendment no longer
requires the state legislature to act as a mediator between the local government
and that of Washington.  A senator who promises to give away too much power from
the body which appoints him will not long be in his job.  This is not the concern
of the voting public for the vast majority; One cares not where the funds
originate, but merely that the services are provided.  The federal government,
being the repository of a treasury much deeper than that of any more local
entity, holds both a stick and a carrot in the attraction of power to itself. 

Jonah Goldberg writes of Wilson's suspicion of the masses of men, quoting Wilson
to say that the "most despotic of governments under the control of wise
statesmen is preferable to the freest ruled by demagogues" and that he would
limit "the error of trying to do too much by vote" and "let administrative study
find the best means for giving public criticism this control and for shutting it
out from all other interference" as "self-government does not consist in having
a hand in everything, any more than housekeeping consists necessarily in cooking
dinner with one's own hands."[^1] Goldberg summates his view of Wilson later
saying, "It is difficult to exaggerate Wilson's arrogant and sovereign contempt for
 the system set up by the Founders." 

This is but quote mining to construct a Wilson which can be responsible for the
rest of the century of growing governmental power. 


<!-- Write here about governmental power as something which grew out of -->
<!-- structual necessity. -->

In *Congressional Government[^2]* Wilson spends much of his discussion on the
way by which regular order in the house proves less open to democratic oversight
than advertised.  Much of the legislative process being conducted inside a
committee system opaque, a black box into which legislation goes and does not
again appear until a deal is a fait accompli.  Now that all has been settled
does it one more come to the floor of the house for an amendment process already
negotiated to the fullest extent possible.  All votes are assured before any
tally is taken, for why would a politician put a name to a vote if there were
nothing to be had in the end?
