Godwin's law has been reborn, this time as "Fascism".  It is just anther way to
talk about the same thing.

Contentious topics have more and more people running to their battlements.
Moral panic seems so easy to provoke now-a-days, both on the left as well as the
right.  The couching may be different, but the middle of the discussion is
hollowing out quickly, leaving one to only have extreme positions on both
sides.  Once the rational middle have been made a no-man's land, Godwin's Law
then comes in naturally.

As Godwin's Law was originally stated, "As an online discussion grows longer, the
probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1".  There have
always been those of bad faith that will figure out how to include the Nazis in
any argument.  The modern evolution of this seems to be the reference to Fascism
on the left, which is Godwin's Law in action, minus that one desecrated name,
Hitler.

To talk of Fascism in today all too easy.  It has become a scare-word that calls
the forces today synonymous with those of a previous age, 


Reading Henry Giroux's article titled *The Nightmare of Neoliberal Fascism*[^1],
one can't help but wonder if such hyperbole can really be considered an argument
at all, or more just the mental ejaculation of an agitated mind.  It is more
just a spontaneous throwing together of disconnected phenomena in some attempt
to imply common causation.  

The problems most often had with the Neoliberalism of modernity is not so much
to do with *structural oppression*, which has dissipated for the most part with
the same Neoliberal uncaring.  The same people who posit systems of oppression
always also with to build some new governmental edifice.  This is the real
problem of modern oppression, it may very well be baked into the system not in a
way extricable, instead, the problem of distribution curves. There will always
be thick tails on any bell curve which compels competition as primary.  Any
sport has the same distributional curves as does capitalism.  To end in some
Libertarian paradise is to have no *systems* of oppression, only statistical
generalities.  One can only ask then, "Is capitalism fair?" as a game at all.

I find it hard to understand why everything which the radical left wants has to
happen at the nation level.  Is there no power beneath that?  There is little
push any more for organizing labor unions.  No one is talking strikes and union
dues.  The economy has changed.  Who is going to organize all the small service
jobs.  Monopsony in the labor market no longer exists, instead fragmenting the
landscape of employers over a myriad field.  

So now everyone waits for some governmental action.  If worker ownership is a
good idea, then why do not the workers start a collective business?  If there is
an economic advantage to such a structure, it should be able to compete just
fine in a capitalist labor system.  One cannot have it both ways, such that
capital is the driving force with underlays all of the relations of humanity,
and at the same time claim that "Greed" is somehow the problem.  Greed denotes
an excessive want of capital.  Who is their to claim that in the Western world
everyone is not subject to the same thing. 

Studies show that the majority of people claim that to multiply their income by
1.5 would make them happy (find sources).  This same multiplier exists for those
who make $100k a year and those who make $1,000,000.  


All those who want to overthrow the system desire to do so with this magic
called "collective action", a mysterious rising of the desire for a group
solidarity.  The boogie man which will disallow this spontaneous collectively
the problem of corporations which have so much money they can control your
mind.
