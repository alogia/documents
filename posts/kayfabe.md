WrestleMania has made a come back, but not as a sport with men wearing tights
and strutting about a ring in so obvious a manner.  This time it has become a
political science term to denote something of an inherent insincerity in a
politician or voter.  The Economist has found in Trump something less of a
politician than an inveterate wrestler[^1] (a connection quite natural, as
Donald Trump has indeed been in the actual ring [^2]).  But what is this line of
the specious and when has one truely crossed it?  Politics has always been
something proposed as consisting of the *rational voter* who knows his
self-interest and votes accordingly.  But this is in the end all a fiction, a
construct which has been the basis of the justification underlying our
democratic republic since its inception.  This was not to say that there was not
also the threat of the tyrant which could rise in the midst of the democratic
process and overwhelm it.  It was Plato[^3] who James Madison quoted when
thinking about democracy: it was a system unstable as an excess of liberty will
push inexorably to a tyranny.  

Politics has in the end always tended to an irrationality in this country[^4]
and I would suspect most others.  There is what Brian Caplan would call
"rational irrationality" in the voting public[^5]; each voter has so little a
chance of casting a decisive vote, that the penalty of voting irrationally is
negligible almost all of the time.  The paradox of the system is the same as the
Tragedy of the Commons, that en masse voters will collectively push politics
into something irrational even though each voter has little say.  

The Question really is one of the sincerity of the actual act in modern life, or
whether this now must come secondary to the signaling inherent in any act.  Both
the left and the right are subject to the same forces, one of which is the now
intolerable 'woke' college student who protests thing which are nothing other
than ridiculous if given any objective viewpoint.  Then you have the response to
the left's ridiculousness, which to the Turning Point USA crowd, which finds the
idea of rebellion in Donald Trump.

The notion of 'meme' has come to full flower with the internet.  We have moved
ever farther away from the thing in and of itself and more into an economy of
the symbolic. 

There has always been a symbolic order, that of the religious especially, a
place where the archetypes were primary, where we could let the quantification
of life go a little bit and fall back into that system of emotions too deep to
have a name.
