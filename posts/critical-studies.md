I am still unsure of some of the truth claims made by the practitioners of any
of the Critical Theories.  If one is to view events or systems in a way that is
self-defined as a mere 'lens', this seems to me more a transparent admission of
Narrative construction.  This remnant of Derrida was merged with the power
analysis of Foucault and the end of Marcuse, and melded into some ungainly new
ideology as much a grab-bag as Christianity was in its day.

Yet the arbitrary manner in which 'lens' can be constructed can produce
whatever outcome one is looking for.  Considering that most progressive
legislation is as concerned with intent as with outcome, it is easy to produce a
lens with can critique the policy proscriptions of the same proponents.  Of all
the reasons why a proposal for a constitutional amendment to verify which
polices are racist or anti-racist, *a la* Ibram Kendi, the one which I would
think most relevant to the left is that there are an infinite number of causal
connections which can be drawn in a system as complex as a modern culture.

Take the example of the minimum wage.  One can just as easily decide that a low
minimum wage is a cause of black poverty, which is the assumed lens on the left,
as one can call for its abolition so as to make employable more black youth in
the search for employment parity.

One can do the same with something like incarceration.  One can call the
difference between Black and White prison populations an aspect of systemic
racism, yet one can also call the disproportionate crime in black neighborhoods
the same thing.  One calls for a smaller judicial footprint, the other a larger
one.

The basic premise of Critical Legal studies is that systems are complex and can
produce results which are unintended by any of the participants.  What is an
unacknowledged corollary to that is that interpretation is just as contingent as
any outcome.  Even a smaller field such as economics is proof that evidence can
be marshaled for a variety of causes and only un-provable axioms determine which
case to aver.
