\chapter{Desert}
\label{cha:desert}
\begin{aquote}{Latex Memoir Class Documentation}
  \textbf{memoir}, \textit{n.} a fiction designed to flatter the subject and to impress the reader.
\end{aquote}


I remember the desert most.  Days of walking down roads which led nowhere in the
hot sand and silence, my form of nihilism.  Whole days I would be gone, starting
in the comparative cool of the morning and returning as the sun set over a flat
horizon an incomparable distance away.  After school, after work, on the
weekends I would always seem to wander off a bit farther, never wanting to turn
back.  I would walk with water always, big jugs that I would lug along which
would start with ice and slowly warm to tepid, and then the hot before I could
quaff enough to sate the heat which dripped down my legs and dried crisp and
salty on my neck.  Yet it didn't matter.  Nothing mattered out there except to
keep going, to stay in motion for its own sake.  There was nothing else to do.
Walking was meditation, a activity to involve nothing but that one action in the
legs.  It was a escape in slow motion.  In the desert one could think and feel
and contemplate, and it was at the same time the irrelevance of the quotidian in
the silence and stillness of the terrain.  

Casting out into this distances in some omphalocentric perambulation, I always
arrive back where I begun both in mind and body, back at my house, an old single
wide trailer with wall of faded and broken paneling and a roof with tires on the
top for a reason I never knew and never asked.  The front door faced a view
miles in size, and I would stand on the creaking gray wooden porch and
contemplate the mountains distant, ever inviting me to their feet for no
purpose.

The first landmark that one would find after leaving down the dirt road which
stretched out from home was a dirt damn known as \textit{the pond}.  This
purported `pond' usually was devoid of water and instead just a dry brown basin
to stand as emblem of the constant aridity of the landscape.  When the rains
would finally come first hesitantly, then completely, myriad arroyos would fill
the pond with a fragrant brown liquid still foamy after its hurried course.  And
suddenly a life hidden beneath the mud would emerge in the form of a million
frogs whose frenzied calls could be heard through the walls at night.  It was
the sound of a life-cycle, the hurried croaking in the dark while the water
drained away till only tadpoles remained frozen in clay, fossils which would
fade in days and then be gone with no trace of the life dug beneath the baked
earth.  A vast system of scales would appear where once water had been, and dry
till each crack curled upward and detached like sun-burnt skin, a flaky sea
that crunched underfoot.

That pond has always stuck with me, this one symbol of the desert, of my
childhood taking the dogs out walking, our big lumbering dog named Spike and her
tiny Chihuahua companion running hard by her side.  Spike would disappear for
hours some times, and come home panting dirty with some adventure that only she
would ever know.

--- I could often be found next door digging up my uncle's yard, uprooting
mesquite bushes, battling their spines, reworking the land to something less
than wild.  My uncle and I had a struck a deal in which he would pay for my
first computer (a Gateway machine with a 10G hard-drive, a CD burner, a floppy
drive, and a dial-up modem) and I would landscape his yard at five dollars an
hour over the next year.  This was the point that I really fell into my
life-long love of computers.  I remember when I discovered the brilliant way in
which a web page worked, the systematic markup and the intricate way that
everything came together.  To think in the way that a computer thinks is to
contort one's mind into the ultimate systematic methodology of deconstructing
problems.  These problems are defined well enough on the computer, small
microcosms with fixed inputs and fixed outputs.  Yet, this type of thinking is
something which will scale upward also, structuring the ways that one thinks
about more complex aspects of nature.  I am always interested in the lack of
overlap between computer scientists and philosophers, as both seem to reinforce
each other. To my knowledge, the only philosopher of note has been Mencius
Moldbug \todo{Write about Moldbug?}, computer scientist and radical political
theorist.

Seven years I was home-schooled before I had taken the plunged and gone back to
public high-school starting freshman year.  It was a year of great angst and
exploration, this the first great Individuation from the outside.  Life prior
had been one familial, that of cousins and uncles primarily outside the nucleus
of mother and sister.  I would ramble between houses and desert, video games and
22 caliber rifles.  The heat was always present, a dry baking in the sun, in the
sand, a brief reprieve of the pool or a sprinkler till once again the dry heat
held me.  All this was my world till I turned fourteen and it opened to a whole
host of divergent lives which came and went in intersecting spirals.  The
cousins had all faded, all graduated or moved away, the diffusion of life in
full force.

I met Tony sitting on the floor in an indoor basketball court.  This was Phys
Ed, that awkward required class that all had to finally give themselves to.
Tony, a strapping Irish boy ended on the floor next to me for our next set of
push-ups.  Looking at my long hair and plaid attire (standard at the time), his
first words were, ``Hey, hippy!''.  And thus began a friendship.

Tony was the consummate extrovert who was always cultivating a network of
connections.  He would befriend all those in his orbit, charming each with how
comfortable he made himself in his own skin.  Good looking and well built, he
worked on his bad-boy shtick constantly, always making sure to clarify how

Tony wanted to go pick up a girl he had been seeing lately, some new momentary
interest.  Tony never really dated girls so much as to have them around when in
need of some entertainment.  He could find no common ground, could have no
synonymous thoughts with this other sex, he having cultivated his bad-boy
persona so well, that this would be a bridge too far, an admission of something.
He would always make a point of reminding us, ``Bros before Hoes'', with such
certainty that it would diffuse the problem that everyone else was perpetually
single.  

After we had kicked around the hack enough and had found a good high, I
agreed and we drove across town.  Tony had a habit of knowing people across
town, far away in other friend-groups that were beyond all of us but Tony.  And
so I drove till we parked outside a generic middle-class home and out ran a girl
who jumped in.

Snider and I would skip school and drive out into the desert and play
hackysack and smoke pot for hours till hunger and pain took us back to eat.
Back at my house I would make a skillet overflowing with stacked red enchiladas,
refried pintos, top in lettuce and tomatoes and sided with chips and toast with
honey.  We would feast till we were both sated and unmovable and contemplate our
day and try to forget the morrow.  

---------

Prom night the triad of Tony, Snider and I decide it was time instead for a boys
night, a protest against our being single.  We would instead take the night by
storm and have a party our own.  There are certain dates which are tyrannical in
their implicit expectation.  As much as the idea is denounced or the holiday
derided, the lack of a feeling, an experience, is felt a loss nonetheless.  It
is to be sad for something one wants not to want.  Being alone on December 25th
will always feel a magnitude more empty than any other day; and the same is true
of those who try and deny Prom its due.

We had passed money to the right person and ended with alcohol, a thing
difficult to obtain normally.  After having scoured the town for parties, for
things interesting and coming up short, we decided to go visit Paul who lived in
the Porta-Potty at the park.

The three of us had met Paul a month prior.  After a good hack session going
late into the night, Tony took leave to relieve himself by visiting the line of
Porta-Potties set shoddily at the edge of the parking lot, the solution to a
broken bathrooms never repaired.  Tony, having approached the largest of the
lot, one made for the possibly disabled or the odd family, threw open the door
and started in only to be standing approximately on top of someone sleeping on
the floor.  After both had let out the appropriate expletive laden sounds, with
Tony having retreaded a good several yards in a motion not unlike teleportation,
everyone stopped to take stock of what had just happened.  The commotion had
brought myself and Snider over to have a look.  Tony gave us a recap of having
just kicked a man lying on the floor of the blue toilet, and after a strained
laugh, we conferenced as to what to do?  Was the guy drunk?  Was he dying?  Why
was he there?  ``Well, better ask'', Tony decided for the lot of us, and once
more approaching the potty knocked gently and bid the inhabitant a questioning
hello.  The response was normal enough for a man found sleeping in a park in an
extra-large portable toilet.  He even was nice enough to open the door after a
strained exchange of greetings and we came to know his name as Paul.

Paul was a man that looked like life hadn't given him a good day for a decade or
more.  Wearing dirty stain sweatpants and turtleneck fashionable for the 50s, he
told us of himself.  A man more in body than in mind, he seemed in a cycle of
the street.  His last attempt to find four walls not of plastic ended when his
last check was mugged, leaving him again to return to his Porta-Potty.  A simple
man, torn to pieces by life, left to the vicissitudes un-understandable to a
mind like his. Not only was it his mind, but also his body that had the worst of
it, with him missing a leg. Or such was what we assumed given his awkward gate
and the odd \textit{swoooshing} sound of a compressing hinge emanating from the
pants hiding his knee-like apparatus as he walked.  We bought him Taco Bell and
wished him well, for what else could we do?

Paul was the poor \textit{reprobatus} of some Calvinist deity, someone too low
in life to ever find a salvation.  These are the un-elect whom one feels helpless to
help, Paul floating in a world too far away to ever find his way back, in some unjust
judgment too hard for us to contest, too complicated for our own lives filled
already.  We drove away talking in low tones about how life can take a person to
such lows, unimaginable to us.  It was then that we decide on the one small
step, that one thing we could do for us as much as Paul, was to buy him a bungee
cord to keep his door closed at night.  The following day, we went on a mission
to the nearest home store to get this ersatz lock, gifting it to him with
several tacos and a twenty dollar bill.

It was too this Paul that we went with beer and pot and tacos in hand.  As it
turned out, Paul was nowhere to be found, and would never be found by us again.
We ate his Tacos and set up in the park anyway,

High-school is the age which one can still be said to have `promise', some
mystical check to cash in the future.  My life at this time rode always two
parallel paths, one of promise, and one of dissolution.  The last year of
high-school I fought for an extra Advanced Placement class, a fifth
college-level chemistry instead of a standard four class semester, or the two
classes I needed to graduate. This is called, ``being an over-achiever.''  Yet,
my days were spent mostly in debauch, in search of the good time of drugs
and dissipation.  I would come to class high most mornings having not done my
homework.  I made no apologies, took zeros on the work and got As on tests, and
generally acted like I didn't care a whole lot.  I had always harbored a secret
comfort of being certain I was the smartest student in most rooms I entered.
To ensure I never had to  test the issue, I held my grades lightly, uncaringly
as a shield.  

The economies of public schools are so very different from their purported
mission.  Those who are good at learning the material of which most classes
consist is something disincentivized by the majority of one's peers.  And this
is the paradox, the difference that one must always split between that of the
peer-group, and then that of the institution.  My game was to play both sides of
the field, to be both the rebel and the scholar.  To find approbation on both
sides and not have to choose.

Was it this that led to the great discovery of my youth, that I had to break all
molds if I was to not be found lacking in some metric.  I would break the
meter, reform the measurements, and by this I would avoid judgment, for to what
standard could I be held?  

\chapter{Adobe}
\label{cha:adobe}
I came to Santa Fe following the whiff of truth.  I was subject to the mistake
of all those who find philosophy for the first time; to think life really
reducible to a predicate logic like Russel's \textit{Principia} such that if one
were to follow it out far enough, there in the end would be some shinning Truth
to calm that unnamed disquiet which pervades youth.  One cannot yet accept there
are no answers, only experimentation, only questions fraught with unclear
answers.  The tyranny of our freedom has yet to find us.

I ended in Santa Fe with too much stuff in tow.  Two CRT monitors, all my
programming books, and the general contents of my closet back home were to
remake my life in this new place.  The problem was to split the difference
between two emotions always operative at inflection points; that of finding some
bit of the familiar to grab onto while at the same time jumping into the
unknown.  Individuation comes in spurts, and the moment one moves from home
is a maximal point of change with little left in the way of the familiar.  Yet
youth loves adventure, 

One was only to ever increase oneself both in mind and body, not
necessary in corpulence, but in ones adjuncts.  Accouterments all expanded
oneself, a form of the extended phenotype which would push the self outward.

\chapter{Forest}
\label{cha:forest}

To live in the forest is to know oneself not part of nature.  It is be sure the
universe has ends not your own.  Religion is waning in the West for a good
reason; when most of the world seems made to cater to our whims what is there to
remind us that we live only in a shell of our own creation.

I moved to the forest while patches of snow still stood brindling the
ground. Most of my possessions had been carted back down south with the help of
my mother, leaving only myself and an old forest-green canvas duffel bag which
dwarfed my frame as I struggled out of campus and into the forest to the North.

The question of the possible is so bound by episteme unseen the majority of the
time.  Cultures create systems so seamless that to find a gap is to have found
something brilliant, a pin of light leaking in from the unknown.  These are left
unusually only to those few who are pushed out not of their own will, but
because they where not quite ever in; these are the tramps and the vagabonds,
the addicts and the saints.  Then there are those few of choose, who wish to
experiment with life and cast aside all expectation and run headlong into some
unknown.  I would not call this finding the authentic as Sarte would, but
instead call it play.

The human is an amazingly adaptable beast.  The patterns of life necessary for
forest living are all in the end completely manageable.  One's days become
structured just as do all other lives.  There is an inversion which happens, the
hard things becoming easy and the easy becoming hard.  Water becomes something
precious, not had without a huge investment in time and effort.  Yet one has not
to worry about paying the water bill, or of the piping in the house, or of water
the plants in the yard.  Now the difficulty is in the schlepping requisite
bottles of the stuff to camp.  A calculus must always be made between the weight
and the want.  To carry more than necessary is perverse, but to not carry enough
is torture.  Most thing exist between these two points of the campers continuum,
and one is always and forever reevaluating the point one thought ideal
even yesterday. 

I had move into a cloistered life distant from the everyday already.

And so I stocked frozen food and learned the lingo of the bourgeois foodie. I
learned that a boule and hummus made a good snack but if you had a bit of  

\chapter{Hovel}
\label{cha:hovel}

I came back south uncertain, moving to a new city with nothing but the promise
of a job I thought strange already.  I was to move mail up and down a mountain,
starting in Alamogordo, a sleepy town of thirty-five thousand, and transport
my cargo up highway 82 and stop at a series of post offices along the way,
depositing a few thousand pounds of mail in the back rooms of each.  The evening
would bring me back the opposite direction, this time to collect the days mail
and unload at the main post office from which I had begun.  It was a job seven
day a week, as the post office even sorts on Sundays.

The second difficulty of this new gig was the way in which it split the day
between two cities.  One had either to commute both ways a second time, or stay
the night in one place, the day in the other.  Having no place to be and no
vehicle to manage such a thing, I elected for the later.  I elected to stay the
nights in Alamo not in a house or an apartment, which seemed a bit excessive for
the time I was to spend there, and instead just elected to sleep in the desert.
The summer made this easy, really only requiring that I buy a tarp to lay out on
the sand.  I had bought an 10-speed old Reighley racing frame at a bike shop in
town and had it stripped and remade as a beautiful ride.  A Selle Anatomica
saddle, new cables, tires, spokes, chain, and grip tape.  After replacing the
peddles with some old-school toe clips this became my new favorite ride.  There
is something about tube-shifters which makes the riding experience special,
something akin the driving a standard transmission car.  The act of changing
gears becomes costly, and one does not do it with the same abandon that one does
when riding with brifters.  If one must only move a finger to find that perfect
tension in the peddles, to run that one easy crank RPM that is a practiced
natural, it is to miss the beautiful complexity of the tube-shifting bike.

This bicycle would ferry me up the hill to the edge of town where I could lock
it to one of the last light posts before I was to hit the darkness of desert and
open land.  Leaving the bike here for the night, I crossed the street and
make my way up the hill opposite town.

The Sacramento mountains flank Alamogordo, forming a backdrop to the west of
town.  These mountains rise first roundly, then starkly five thousand feet above
the city.  To the east, only the horizon hundreds of miles away forms the rim of
a flat desert without differentiation.  In 1945 the US government built the
largest military installation and missile range in the sprawling desert outside
the largest gypsum deposit on earth, White Sands Monument.  Not long after,
the first atomic bomb darkened the skies above barren basin. After the war
was won, V2 rockets were refined at the

\chapter{Stairs}
\label{cha:stairs}

The first thing one has to learn to do in Vietnam is cross the street.  It
requires a confidence that does not come easily for the occidental just wondered
off the plane.  Everything moves in ways that one can never quite quantify, a
system still opaque in expectation and action.  Traffic is at once something one
could reasonably call a free-for-all, or in the same moment something so planned
out as a minutely choreographed set of intertwined actions.  In actuality is it
the definition of the emergent system. Like the human body, with each part doing
its small bit, something like a vast system emerges.

Like most other countries, the associated food which comes to define the cuisine
in foreign places is not the thing most eaten back at home. With Vietnam, its
two most known exports, Pho and the Banh Mi, are only a small tip of a menu so
vast as make these two items unimportant to the whole corpus.  Why is it that
counties who rely on the import of food from the world likewise only has room
for some small set of dishes?  Is it that there is no demand for the
complexities, or is it that each new restaurant only copies the one before it
until there is a self-enforce monopoly of only a select few dishes arbitrary in
origin?
